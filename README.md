## Overview

Seasoned security professional with 19 years of deep technical experience in security assessment, penetration testing,
security monitoring, incident response, application security, and security architecture. I have a keen interest in
practical applications of large-scale data analysis and infrastructure automation to increase organizational resilience
to cyber attacks and other major disturbances. I also have practical experience automating Cyber Threat Intelligence
sharing and organizing collective security initiatives through cooperative information sharing with public and private
sector entities.
