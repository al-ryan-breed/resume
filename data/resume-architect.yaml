overview: Seasoned security professional with 19 years of deep technical experience in security architecture, real-time operations, indcident response, application security, and penetration testing. I have a keen interest in practical applications of large-scale data analysis and infrastructure automation to deploy and operate resilient systems. I also have practical experience automating Cyber Threat Intelligence sharing and organizing collective security initiatives through cooperative information sharing with public and private sector entities.

    I have over a decade of data-intensive analytical experience in real time cyber security operations and Digital Forensics/Incident Response. Throughout that time, I have both leveraged and built large-scale data processing pipelines to generate insights and maintain situation awareness for both the real-time and historical analytical frames. I have undertaken many data integration projects to combine data sources from heterogeneous vendor platforms when there has been substantial business value to be gained. Finally, as a testament to my interest and determination, I have developed novel analytical techniques based on domain knowledge using a variety of traditional, statistical, and machine-learning approaches. Some samples of this work are available in my GitHub and LinkedIn profiles.
    I also have a strong track record of building performant systems that can scale with workload and operate reliably in hostile networks. I focus on resilient outcomes across all lifecycle stages in environments where technologies and threats change on much tighter loops than release schedules.
