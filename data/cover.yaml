  It is with great interest that I am tendering my application for the position of $job-title$. I have a strong track record of building performant systems that can scale with workload and operate reliably in hostile networks. I focus on resilient outcomes across all lifecycle stages in environments where technologies and threats change on much tighter loops than release schedules. I understand well the non-technical skills necessary to build consensus, communicate expectations, and drive business requirements. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss the position and how my experience can benefit the overall strategic mission.

  It is with great interest that I am tendering my application for the position of $job-title$. I have over a decade of data-intensive analytical experience in cyber security operations. Througout that time, I have both leveraged and built large-scale data processing pipelines to generate insights and maintain situation awareness for both the real-time and historical analytical frames. When tools have been inadequate for business requirements, I have built them. I have also undertaken many data integration projects to combine data sources from heterogeneous vendor platforms when there has been substantial business value to be gained. I understand well the non-technical skills necessary to build consensus, communicate expectations, and drive business requirements. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss the position and how my experience can benefit the overall strategic mission.

My deep background in security analytics helps me to formulate the questions and gather the information necessary for data-driven decision making in both the real time and historical cases.
