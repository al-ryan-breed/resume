To whom it may concern:

It is with great interest that I am tendering my application for the position of <%= ENV['JOB_TITLE'] %>. <%= @flavors[ENV['JOB_FLAVOR']] %>

Beyond my technical expertise, I have made it a priority to develop the necessary soft skills to be effective when working with both technical and non-technical people, especially when complexity or uncertainty come into play. I pride myself on being able to tailor communications appropriately for each audience and each occasion. I understand well the need to build consensus, communicate expectations, and drive business requirements when collaborating both internally and externally.

I look forward to the opportunity to discuss the position and how my experience can benefit the overall strategic mission. Thank you for your time and consideration.
